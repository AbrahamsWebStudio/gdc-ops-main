# GDC Daily Workflow Discipline

Purpose: keep metrics honest and explainable.

## Rule: Every active lead must have a next action
For any lead you are actively working, always set:
- next_action
- next_action_due

If a lead has neither, it is considered unmanaged and should be treated as a warning.

## Rule: Log the interaction immediately after contact
After any call, email, or meeting:
- Create an Interaction record right away.

This is the source of truth for response time and follow-up completion metrics.

## Why this matters (client-safe)
These habits turn activity into reliable numbers. Without them, metrics look random and are easy to doubt.

## Quick daily checklist
- New lead added: next_action + next_action_due set
- Any contact made: interaction logged same day
- End of day: no active lead without a next action
